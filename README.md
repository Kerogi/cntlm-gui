cntlm-gui
=========

This project is a way for me to learn the basics of Qt and C++, its purpose is to give the user the ability to control and configure every aspect of the cntlm service via a simple GUI, instead of working with text files.
The program should parse the file /etc/cntlm.conf and write new configuration files, that can be easily switched if the user has to work behind different proxies.
